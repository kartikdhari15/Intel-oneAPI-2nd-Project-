The objective of the study is to differentiate between the people having Parkinson's Disease and not.This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). There are 6 recordings per patient. Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to differentiate healthy people from those with PD, according to the "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. 

The “XGBoost” algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict a continuous target variable.Also Intel oneDAL(one Data Analytics) Library has been used in the project by using the command !pip install scikit-learn-intelex.
